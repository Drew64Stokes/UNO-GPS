Read Me.

This code does work and may be a starting point for bigger better things, I just needed to get an accurate time and location for an up coming project.

If you use this code please note.

1. Be patient and wait, from my office window it took several minutes for my GPS to latch on to a satelite and start spewing numbers out.
2. Remember the TX from the GPS goes to the RX of the Arduino.

3. I'm not sure if the local time adjustment is as accurate as it might be, but it suits my purpose.
  *** Actually pretty sure this a "dud". Clocking a day, month or year will cause problems, but it still suits my purpose. 
  *** Be Warned!!

4. I use the PinMap_UNO.h file to declutter projects. Use the PinMap_UNO.h file or not as you see fit.

This project is really about me getting my head around using VS Code in conjunction with GITHUB and stepping up my arduino skills, which are probably average at best.

Good Luck!
